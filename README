Reverse engineering the firmware for BYK800/BYK801/BYK870 based mechanical keyboards.

Currently most efforts are focused on the BYK870 since this is the chip in my keyboard (the E-Element Z88), but one can
assume that the BYK800/BYK801 are similar.

Each subdirectory contains the firmware update utility for the respective chip. I originally got these files from
http://www.eyspc.cn/server.aspx?code=0301 but it seems that the downloads are no longer working, so if you are just
looking for the original updater utility you can find it there. The actual firmware blob is encrypted and embedded
inside the executable. You can extract it for disassembly and analysis using fw_decrypt.py.

There are no available datasheets online for the BYK870; however, I figured out that it's actually just a relabeled
version of the SinoWealth SH79F6488 8051-based microcontroller. I've included the datasheet for this part.

By probing my keyboard with a multimeter and looking at some of the code, I figured out some of the GPIO connections of
the microcontroller, which you can find in pinout.txt. I couldn't figure out all of the connections since my keyboard
doesn't have a number pad, which the firmware supports since it's also used in larger keyboards.
