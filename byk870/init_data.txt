format:
ttelllll: t = type, e = extend, l = length or high length
LLLLLLLL: L = low length
if extend, then L is present and repetition happens {l,L} times (only for t = 01)

when t == x0: x = which, 0 = internal ram, 1 = external ram
aaaaaaaa:     a = addr
vvvvvvvv x l: v = value
set int/ext ram at addr a to l values v,v,v,...

when t == 11:
vaaaabbb: v = value, a = addr, b = bit
sets bit b to value v at addr 0x20+a
repeat l times

when t == 01:

AAAAAAAA: low addr
vvvvvvvv x l: v = value
set ext ram at addr {a,A} to l values v,v,v,...
